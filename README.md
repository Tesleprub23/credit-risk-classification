Module 20 Credit-Risk-Classification

The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of the data model that predicts credit worthiness of potential borrowers. 
A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.



Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
•	Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
•	Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the 1's, or predict the 0's? )
If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
